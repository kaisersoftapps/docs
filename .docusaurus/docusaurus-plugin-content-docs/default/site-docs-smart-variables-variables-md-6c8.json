  "description": "Smart variables are dynamic variables that can make your content more flexible. Each smart variable is constructed using a specific syntax called dot notation inside double mustache brackets. It's written as a hierarchy, starting with a top-level object and followed by properties of that object, {{object.property.subProperty}}. Notice that multiword properties use camelCase capitalization.",
