# Parent Field

## Overview

"Parent Field" is a read-only field that displays any specified field (e.g., status, assignee, priority) from the parent issue, if one exists. This allows for a quick reference to parent issue details without navigating away.

## Use Cases

- **Parent Assignee/Status/Labels/Priority and other fields:** Display the value of the parent issue's field (epic for standard tasks, standard tasks for sub-tasks) without needing to switch between the current issue and its parent.
