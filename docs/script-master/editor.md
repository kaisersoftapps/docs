# Code Editor


## Overview

Script Master is now embedded with a more reliable and efficient editor - the Monaco editor. This editor has various useful features that give Atlassian administrators a better scripting experience.

This editor powers one of the most popular and effective editors â€” Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but it does not fully replace it, of course.


## Features

The features of the Monaco editor are as follows:

- **IntelliSense**. This term represents a variety of code features. These features include auto-completion of code, providing parameters and quick information, and displaying member lists.
- **Documentation and quick information**. You can view quick information for each method by either pressing the "autocomplete" shortcut or clicking the info icon. The accompanying explanation for the method or parameter expands to the side.
- **Parameter information and function signature**. After selecting a method or member function, the parameter information is displayed. You can also hover over a function to view its documentation or explanation.
- **Code linting**. The real-time code linting feature highlights syntactical and stylistic problems in the source code of JavaScript functions. ***Not available in JavaScript in HTML (like Fragments)***.
