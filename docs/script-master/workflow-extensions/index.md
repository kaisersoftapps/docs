# Workflow Extensions

:::tip Compatibility

This module available in Script Master for **Jira** only.

:::


## Overview 

Enhance your Jira workflows using scripted extensions like [Scripted Post-Functions](./workflow-post-functions/index.md), [Scripted Validators](./workflow-validators/index.md), and [Scripted Conditions](./workflow-conditions/index.md). These powerful tools allow you to automate transitions, enforce validation rules, and control transition availability based on custom criteria, making your workflows more dynamic and tailored to your needs.

## Post-Functions
Script Master allows you to customize Jira workflows with [scripted post-functions](./workflow-post-functions/index.md), which are executed during issue transitions. These scripts can perform tasks like updating issues, sending requests, or modifying data.

## Validators
Workflow validators ensure that a transition meets certain conditions before proceeding. [Custom scripted validators](./workflow-validators/index.md) can enforce rules based on issue data or user actions.

## Conditions
[Scripted Workflow conditions](./workflow-conditions/index.md) prevent transitions from being available unless certain criteria are met, such as issue status or user permissions.
