# Mindmap

## Overview

A mind map is a diagram that visually organizes information into a hierarchy, highlighting relationships among different parts. It usually starts with a central concept in the middle of a page, with related ideas, images, and words branching out from it. Major ideas connect directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from these main ideas.
